# CoronaProject

We have developed a dashboard that is automatically fed by a daily data flow from the sites mentioned and this automatically. We carried out statistical calculations, and used visualization tools under python to allow an easier understanding of the data. the dashboard contains 3 pages that we will take care to describe in this report:

- Worldwide: for visualization of worldwide data
- France: To view data for France by region
- Modeling: for easy and understandable visualization and configuration of the SEAIRD model
The development of the dashboard is done in the form of a small dynamic, responsive and multi-page dashboard web application with Dash (Python open source framework).
